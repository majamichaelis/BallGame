# BallGame
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a very simple game developed using the Unity engine. It was one of my <b>very first</b> Unity projects.
<br><b>The project will be expanded in the future!</b> </p>

<h2>Game Description</h2>
<p>The game involves controlling a ball. The player's objective is to collect 10 diamonds scattered around the field. If the player collects all 10 diamonds before the time runs out, they win. If time runs out before all diamonds are collected, the player loses. Additionally, if the ball touches a skull, it is reset to its starting position.</p>
